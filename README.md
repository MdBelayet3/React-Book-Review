# React Book Review

My Website:

- [Awesome/book](https://react-book-review375.netlify.app/)

Here are five key features and characteristics about my website :

 1. Interactive Navbar and Routing: The website features a user-friendly navbar with a logo, navigable menu items, and sign-in/sign-up buttons. The active route state is displayed on the navbar for clear navigation, which is consistently visible across all pages.

 2. Dynamic Book Listings and Details: A JSON file is created to populate book data, including detailed fields like author, rating, and category. The main Books section displays book cards in a structured, grid layout, and each book card links to a dynamic details page showing complete information and interactive buttons.

 3. Customizable Book Actions and Local Storage Integration: Users can add books to their Read or Wishlist sections. Notifications are triggered for first-time actions, duplicate additions, or when attempting to add an already-read book to the wishlist. All selected books are saved in local storage for future reference.

 4. Listed Books Page with Sorting and Tabs: This page displays books saved in the Read and Wishlist categories, with sorting options by rating, total pages, or publishing year. Tab functionality allows users to switch between Read and Wishlist views easily.

 5. Pages to Read Page with Custom Bar Chart: The "Pages to Read" page showcases a unique bar chart visualizing the total pages for each book on the read list, making it easy for users to track reading progress visually. The design and functionality mirror the Figma design for a cohesive user experience.
